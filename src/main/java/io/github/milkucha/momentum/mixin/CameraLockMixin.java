/**
 * Blocks mouse look input from reaching the player while riding an AutomobileEntity
 * with lockCamera enabled.
 *
 * Minecraft applies mouse deltas by calling Entity.changeLookDirection(yaw, pitch)
 * on the local player each tick. Cancelling that call here means no mouse movement
 * ever reaches the player's yaw/pitch — no fighting, no jitter.
 *
 * The END_CLIENT_TICK handler in MomentumClient still runs and sets
 * player.setYaw(auto.getYaw()) each tick, so the camera follows the car's heading
 * as it turns. With no mouse input competing, this is clean and smooth.
